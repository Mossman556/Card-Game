# Card Game
This is a simple memory matching card game developed for Windows using C# and XAML. The game is designed for players to test and improve their memory and attention skills. The objective of the game is to find all pairs of matching cards within the shortest possible time and with the fewest possible attempts.

# Features
* A grid of 16 cards is displayed, arranged face down.
* The player clicks on two cards to flip them over, revealing their images.
* If the two cards match, they remain face up and are removed from the grid.
* If the two cards do not match, they are flipped face down again and the player may try again.
* The game ends when all pairs of matching cards have been found.
* The player's score is based on the number of attempts they make to find all the matching pairs.
